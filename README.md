# All-about-Sputnik
What is Sputnik Network? <br />

For now, The Sputnik Network is an ecosystem of services that are connected Web2 and Web3. <br />
We alraedy have Sputnik Network Bot, that works in Twitter and Telegram. <br />
Any user of Twitter can login with Twitter-account to https://sputnik.exchange and topup balance of $ATOM, $KAVA, $IOV, $SCRT, $HARD or $USDX <br />
Users of Twitter with available balnce can send crypto-tips to any other Twitter-user, even if this user didn't create an account. <br />
To send crypto-tip, all you need is make a comment, write anything you want, or write nothing, and add: <br />
"<@username> <amount> <crypto> #sputnik"  <br />
> For example: @ponimajushij 0.567atom #sputnik
After comment will be published, Sputnik Network Bot will see it in Twitter, and it will transfer from your balance 0.567 $ATOM to the balance of @ponimajushij <br />
Also, users can send multy-crypto-tips in one comment! <br />
All you need is to write in comment: <br />
> @ponimajushij 0.123atom @_krogla 1.23kava @kogisin_jayb 12.3iov #sputnik
After comment will be published, @ponimajushij will receive 0.123 $ATOM, @_krogla will receive 1.23 $KAVA and @kogisin_jayb will receive 12.3 $IOV <br />

In Telegram, all you need is to start Sputnik Network Bot: https://t.me/SputnikNetworkBot and topup your balance <br />
Users of Telegram can not only send and receive crypto in 3 clicks, but also use p2-exchange! <br />
